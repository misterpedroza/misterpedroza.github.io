                        Omar Pedroza is the first member of his family to join the U.S. Military (where he experienced some of the most intense and rigorous military training), pursue a higher education (by studying Social Welfare at the most notorious public university), and pursue a law enforcement career.

                    <p>An ambitious Mexican-American dreamer, Mr. Pedroza has undergone some of the most difficult military training in the world at the Basic Reconnaissance Course where he endured sleepless nights, extremely physically demanding tasks, and learned the fundamentals of conducting reconnaissance and surveillance missions for the United States Marine Corps elite Recon units. Mr. Pedroza will also be graduating with a Bachelor’s of Arts in Social Welfare from UC Berkeley in December 2020 with honors. Soon after, Mr. Pedroza will be joining law enforcement with the hope of changing the common narrative of law enforcement misconduct within the United States. He will also pursue the position of Special Forces Officer within the National Guard while serving as a law enforcement officer.</p>
